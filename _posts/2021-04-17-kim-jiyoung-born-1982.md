I have trouble writing much about this book. I really struggled to finish the book due to its style. It felt like a trudge to get through what is overall a pretty short book.

The book is written in a clinical style -- intentionally to appear like a report written by a medical professional. Unfortunately I found this style incredibly dry, making it hard to get into the story.

To me this distracted from the important subject the novel was about -- the challenges of sexism that women in Korea face.

All this said, I admit that I am probably not in the right position to judge this book. For the right audience, it could hit differently. Maybe it's better in Korean.
