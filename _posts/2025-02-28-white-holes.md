> We are the irreversible foam of free energy that was trapped in the disequilibrium between hydrogen and helium, freed by the Sun.

> This, in the end, is a Planck star: a shortcut to the future. A way to hide safely for a moment, while outside eons of time flow slowly by.

I read this book after being reminded of the author's work by a [Perimeter Institute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ADopTdBVTQ).

Overall the ideas contained within _White Holes_ are super interesting but I found myself disappointed by the structure and information density within the book. Even with this book being relatively quite short it felt like it was thin and repetitive, an unfortunate combination.

Ultimately I was looking for more.
