A perfectly-suitable broad overview of Facebook, focused more on the near history than the distant. Well-written.

The book brought some interesting information to the foreground and did a good job organizing it. Regardless any given source or story within the the book was novel, the challenge with my perception of this book was that it all feels like it has been told before, whether or not that is true. 

The revenue graph at the beginning of each chapter was especially cute.
