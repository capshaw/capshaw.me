> Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.

Eloquent, dense with purpose, a must-read.

As a primary source for the state of race equality and freedom in the 1960s, this book is excellent. 

Dr. King is an eloquent writerâ€”almost every line in the book is above average in its presentation and stands on its own as a powerful quote. [You can find some of my favorites on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/notes/11082099-why-we-can-t-wait/47386886-andrew-capshaw).
