_Clade_ is a weekend read about a near future where climate change has accelerated, bringing with it disaster as it worsens.

The book is short. Disproportionately it spans across three generations of family facing the increasingly bad environmental affects of climate change. 

In trying to cover so much ground, the book fails to develop the characters, their motivations, and the full implications of the changing world around them.
