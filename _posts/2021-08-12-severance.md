_Severance_ is an entrancing novel that drew me in with short-and-sweet chapters. "Just one more chapter" I would find myself saying as I read more than I intended in any given sitting.

What interested me in _Severance_ was the promise of another _Station Eleven_-like storyline. While this novel can't quite live up to the masterpiece that is _Station Eleven_, it's still really good and worth a read. If I had one complaint, it would be the pop-culture name-dropping. It's just too much for me.

_Severance_ is also surreal in the world of Covid. What if Covid broke society more dramatically. Would it go down like this?
