> But the ever-inflating valuation was blinding for all involved; it was easy to believe that everything was working fine because everyone was getting richer on paper.

_The Cult of We_ is an engaging book that reads like fiction. It's hard to believe that the We company made it as far as it did with such disfunction.

It's a snapshot of an era when money was flowing freely and office culture wasn't burdened with the disruption of covid. The pure number of times tequila is a relevant part of the story is staggering.

The book is well-written and enjoyable to read. Knowing the chapters are short draws you in for one after another.

In a sense, this can be considered a management bookâ€”a lesson in what not to do and how not to act.
