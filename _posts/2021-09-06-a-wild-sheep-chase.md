Like most Murakami books, could be best described as an odd, incongruous, dream. It also is filled to the brim with all of the classic Murakami tropes including—but not limited to—cats, divorce, classical music, and cooking.

I wouldn't recommend it as someone's first Murakami book, but worth reading for those who have read many of his novels.
