_Dark Matter and Dark Energy_ was a fine overview of the history and the various theories that have developed around dark matter and dark energy.

Unfortunately for such a short book, many of the chapters were context-setters and didn't bring much to the table for those who have read other books about cosmology. The overlap can't really be blamed too much—this certainly brought a strong cohesion to the book.

One novel thing to me I haven't read about before is using fossil records to understand potential dark matter interactions of the past—neat!

This is a well-written primer and one I'd recommend near the start of one's introduction into the world of pop-sci cosmology.
