> Now I’m consumed by the worst of it. The grief and sorrow of it. How Facebook is helping some of the worst people in the world do terrible things. How it’s an astonishingly effective machine to turn people against each other. And monitor people at a scale that was never possible before. And manipulate them. It’s an incredibly valuable tool for the most autocratic, oppressive regimes, because it gives them exactly what those regimes need: direct access into what people are saying from the top to bottom of society. 

Remarkable book that I didn't want to put down. 

The story of Facebook and this author's experience there is unbelievable. The sheer amount of disinterest the company has shown over the years and the resulting harm the company has done to its employees, its users, and society is unfathomable. 

I'd recommend this book to most people interested in this topic. Beyond an incredible story, the writing and structure are also top tier.
