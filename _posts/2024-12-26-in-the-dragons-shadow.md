_This is my book review for In the Dragon's Shadow. For the full notes, see [this post]({% post_url 2024-12-26-in-the-dragons-shadow-full-notes %})._

_In the Dragon's Shadow_ is a packed history book focused on international relations between Southeast Asian countries and China. Each chapter in the book focuses on a single country in the region and goes through the recent happenings of these countries both internally and externally, especially as related to the world super powers.

I thought it was effective and I certainly learned a lot. The book feels like a great primer to learn about this area of the world and the 'further reading' list feels like it would provide some compelling deep dives.

For better or worse, there were some countries I was more interested in learning about than others and that made the second half a bit of a slower read for me. But that's mostly on me.

While I think this book was good, I am not sure I'd recommend it to most people unless you're particularly interested in this part of the world. It's a bit more information than the average person will want or need. But interesting nonetheless.
