I have nostalgia for a certain style of web design that I think was mostly prevalent in the early 2000s (I could be misdating this). I'm not sure the actual name of this style of web design either, but I think it's related to the concept of HTML's `<fieldset>`, which is also stylistically out of relevance.

Below is an example of the sort of design that I miss—

<style>
    .example-nostalgia-container {
        max-width: 300px;
        margin: 30px auto;
        /* margin: auto; */
    }
    .example-nostalgia-header {
        background: #C33149;
        color: #fff;
        font-weight: bold;
        padding: 10px;
    }
    .example-nostalgia-body {
        border: 1px solid #C33149;
        padding: 10px;
    }
</style>

<div class="example-nostalgia-container">
    <div class="example-nostalgia-header">
        Example
    </div>
    <div class="example-nostalgia-body">
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
    </div>
</div>

There's several things I miss about this style of web design. One is explicitly related to this design—the design puts boxes around things that are related to one another and makes it very clear how things on a page fit together.

The second thing is less explicitly related to the design, but is related to the era. It brings me back to a time when pages didn't try to do complex things on the frontend—instead, links would bring users to a new page that handled the request. Both as a user and builder, that's something I miss.

Ultimately, I miss the simplicity of this era!
