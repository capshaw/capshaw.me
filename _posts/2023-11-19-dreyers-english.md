Sometimes this book was too smart for its own good. I found the writing style, which often referenced the subject rules by breaking them, to be a little distracting from the content. 

The first half was better than the second half. The chapters that consisted of long lists of words alphabetized were a bit of a slog to get through.

The book was fun though.
