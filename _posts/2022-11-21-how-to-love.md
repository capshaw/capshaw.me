I put this book in the category of _books everyone should read_. Perhaps I'd even say that this is a _book everyone should read multiple times in their life_.

_How to Love_ is a short little book of one page advice on relationships, centered on mindfulness and a Zen Buddhist mindset. It's highly approachable and succinct. It's the sort of book that wants you to take your time and think about what you've read. And to consider how it applies to your life.

I would highly recommend this to anyone who is in a relationship or wants to be in a strong relationship. This is such a great book to read slowly and discuss with your partner. Even if you disagreed, it would lead to a great conversation.
