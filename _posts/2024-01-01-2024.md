Welcome to the new year. I'm not feeling up to writing an in-depth 2024 goals post yet, but wanted to at least get this started. This post will be polished in coming weeks when I'm feeling up to it.

Work-in-progress goals for 2024—

- Use more of my free time to read
- Use less of my free time on the internet
- Continue exercising with the intensity I did at the end of 2023 (~5-6 hours a week)
- Cook homemade meals with my partner twice a week

I'll do this by—

- Building routine
- Keeping a log of what I do to force active engagement with what I do
