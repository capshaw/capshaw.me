> The technologies unleashed by Silicon Valley are not neutral. They contain within them the worldviews of the people who develop them; and when they go unquestioned, we allow those very people to make important decisions about how and for whom our society should operate without any democratic deliberation. When we assume that technology can only develop in one way, we accept the power of the people who control that process, but there is no guarantee that their ideal world is one that truly works for everyone. They champion ideas that would ensure that automobiles continue to dominate our transportation system, that active mobility becomes a rentier service as its adoption grows, and that sidewalks are converted into a space for robots instead of people. Such a future would be hostile to the goal of more egalitarian cities and would make us more dependent on commercial interests rather than trying to free us from their control. The futures suggested by the technologies profiled so far are not the kind of world we should be striving toward.

Not a bad overview of how the incentives of corporations and society often do not align. The book is a straightforward and well-structured/argued read. If you have more than a cursory understanding of the recent going-ons in the tech industry, much of the book will not be new to you, and might not be a great use of time. However, the conclusions the author draws and arguments they make were great. Perhaps skimming the histories one is familiar with is the way to go on this book.

While I enjoyed the book it also make me feel a little more disillusioned with the current state of United States infrastructure. The book did give examples of cities and nations that have done iterative things to improve their infrastructure to make it more human-centric. But it's unclear to me how exactly we could achieve similar things in the United States. Unfortunately.

> Ultimately, building better cities and improving peopleâ€™s lives requires challenging the very structures of capitalism itself, structures that are designed to serve profit before people. We can build transportation systems that empower people, facilitate social connections, and reduce the environmental footprint of mobility. But that requires altering social and economic relations to ensure the planning of those systems is based in community needs, not delivering financial returns.
