> This is a book about the industrialisation of decision-making – the methods by which, over the last century, the developed world has arranged its society and economy so that important institutions are run by processes and systems, operating on standardised sets of information, rather than by individual human beings reacting to individual circumstances. This has led to a fundamental change in the relationship between decision makers and those affected by their decisions, the vast population of what might be called ‘the decided-upon’. That relationship used to be what we called ‘accountability’, and this book is about the ways in which accountability has atrophied.

The premise of this book looked super interesting. I had high hopes going in to this book but was ultimately left a little disappointed. I went back and forth between a two and a three for this book.

The book felt like it slowly ambled towards its apex/conclusion but it felt like there was a bunch of set up for little pay off. The ratio of background to connective points and evidence to conclusion felt off. Don't get me wrong. There were some neat points and it was fun learning a bit about the language of cybernetics but I'm not sure what I take away from this book outside of an interest in learning more. I think the book could have especially used more case studies and evidence that back up the author's point.

> The problem here is that unless a lot of effort is expended, it’s easy to create an information system that will always give a particular answer, whatever the truth is. And that answer will appear to be an objective fact, even though it’s actually the result of a lot of implicit assumptions. Once more, we see that important actions can end up being the consequence of decisions nobody made – or, even worse, decisions that people made without realising they were doing so. An accounting system is an almost perfect accountability sink – even the people responsible for constructing it don’t necessarily understand what they’re doing.

Ah, I think I've seen this before!

Would I recommend this? I'm not sure. Once I read more in this space I suspect there might be other options.
