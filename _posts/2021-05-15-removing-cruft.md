I've spent the last day on and off redesigning this site and removing some cruft. 

On the redesign side, I've switched away from the narrow-width serif design to a wider-width sans-serif design. There's not a great reason for this -- I was just getting tired of the old version. Someday I'll get tired for sans-serif font and switch back, I'm sure.

On the cruft side, I've removed various unused assets that have built up over the years and temporarily removed dark mode until I've settled on an overall design. Maintaining dark mode while experimenting with the design doubles the work required. It'll be back. 

Per usual, I am hoping to write more here. I hope that I can make that happen!
