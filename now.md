This now page is inspired by [nownownow](https://nownownow.com/about). The goal of this page is to capture what I'm up to recently. This page should change frequently.

## July 30th, 2022

* I'm currently reading [The World Turned Upside Down: A History of the Chinese Cultural Revolution](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54738207-the-world-turned-upside-down) by Yang Jisheng. It's going a little slower than I would have hoped since the book is packed with an insane level of detail. It's a good book to read before bedâ€”it'll get you there fast ;)
* One goal I have right now is to build up my running endurance after having a couple of light months. I need to get back into a habit! I've been pretty good about running frequently the last couple of weeks, but I need to keep it up looking forward.
* I recently considered switching this site to Netlify. I really liked the service, but I'm both suspicious of free tiers and the premium tiers were both expensive and not useful for my needs. Because of that, I migrated back to my VPS setup. Cheap, fast, and flexible! While temporarily hosting the site on Netlify, I took the opportunity to do a clean OS install on my VPS.
