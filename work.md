I've been an engineering manager based out of Austin, TX for almost five years now. During my time as a manager, I've built up beliefs about what it means to be a great leader. I have also developed thoughts on some anti-patterns to avoid at all costs. This part of my site collects these thoughts and beliefs.

These are my core management tenets

[Leaders should make their calendars public](/work/public-calendars)\
Transparency is key and it's a great opportunity to lead by example
