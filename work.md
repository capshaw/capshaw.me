I have been an engineering manager based out of Austin, TX for almost five years now. 

During my time as a manager, I've built up beliefs about what it means to be a great leader. I've also developed thoughts on some anti-patterns to avoid at all costs. This part of my site collects these thoughts and beliefs. 

- [My leadership philosophy](/work/leadership-philosophy) — these are my core management tenets
- [Leaders should make their calendars public](/work/public-calendars) — transparency is key
- [First 1x1 template](/work/first-1x1) — slightly outdated at this point and in need of a refresh
