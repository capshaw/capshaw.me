    This page is filled with the status of various big life-spanning goals of mine, some more achievable than others.
    By representing them publicly here, I hope to not lose sight of them and let them fall back into the background.

<div class="callout">
    <div class="callout-title">Exercise 1.28 light seconds</div>
    <p>
        At some point in 2023 I made the horrible decision to start tracking my run and erg progress against the distance to the moon. 
        
        Since I've started collecting data (going back at least to 2018), I've exercised <span id="totalMeters">?</span> meters. 
        
        That's <span id="moonPercent">?</span>% of the way to the moon. I've got a way to go!
    </p>
    <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress-bar-inner" id="exerciseProgress">&nbsp;</div><div class="progress-bar-text" id="moonPercentProgressBar">0.23%</div></div>

<script>
    // Congrats, you've subscribed to moon facts.
    const DISTANCE_TO_MOON_M = 384400000;

    function replaceExerciseMeters(data) {
        const ergMeters = data['lifetime_erg_meters'];
        const runMeters = data['lifetime_run_meters'];
        const totalMeters = ergMeters + runMeters;

        const percentToMoon = parseFloat(totalMeters / DISTANCE_TO_MOON_M * 100).toFixed(4)

        document.getElementById('totalMeters').innerHTML = totalMeters.toLocaleString();
        document.getElementById('moonPercent').innerHTML = percentToMoon;
        document.getElementById('exerciseProgress').style.width = percentToMoon + '%'
        document.getElementById('moonPercentProgressBar').innerHTML = '← ' + percentToMoon + '%';
    }

    fetch('/api/erging/lifetime_exercise_meters.json')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(json => replaceExerciseMeters(json))

<div class="callout">
    <div class="callout-title">Learn tiếng Việt</div>
    <p>
        Tôi muốn học tiếng Việt. I hope to become a novice in Vietnamese. To me, this includes basic conversational fundamentals as well as the ability to read elementary texts.

<div class="callout">
    <div class="callout-title">Finish and publish a video game</div>
    <p>
        Another goal I re-initiated in 2023 is to finish a video game.  
        Honestly I don't even have that much interest in making games, but there's this one game from the 90s I really want to play again.

        More coming on this soon, including status tracking.
