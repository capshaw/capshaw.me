    This page is filled with the status of various big life-spanning goals of mine, some more achievable than others.
    By representing them publicly here, I hope to not lose sight of them and let them fall back into the background.

<div class="callout">
    <div class="callout-title">Row to the moon</div>
    <p>
        At some point in 2023 I made the horrible decision to start tracking my erging progress against the distance to the moon. 
        
        Since I've started in June 2023, I've erged <span id="ergMeters">?</span> meters. 
        
        That's <span id="moonPercent">?</span>% of the way to the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below is a progress bar. No that's not a mistake... I've got a way to go. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Will I make it? Probably not. Do I care? No. It's the journey or something.

    // Congrats, you've subscribed to moon facts.
    const DISTANCE_TO_MOON_M = 384400000;

    function replaceErgingMeters(data) {
        const ergMeters = data['season_erg_meters'];
        const percentToMoon = parseFloat(ergMeters / DISTANCE_TO_MOON_M * 100).toFixed(4)
        document.getElementById('ergMeters').innerHTML = ergMeters.toLocaleString();
        document.getElementById('moonPercent').innerHTML = percentToMoon;
        document.getElementById('rowingProgress').style.width = percentToMoon + '%'
    }

    fetch('/api/erging/season_meters.json')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(json => replaceErgingMeters(json))

<div class="callout">
    <div class="callout-title">Learn tiếng Việt</div>
    <p>
        Tôi muốn học tiếng Việt. I hope to become a novice in Vietnamese. To me, this includes basic conversational fundamentals as well as the ability to read elementary texts.

<div class="callout">
    <div class="callout-title">Finish and publish a video game</div>
    <p>
        Another goal I re-initiated in 2023 is to finish a video game.  
        Honestly I don't even have that much interest in making games, but there's this one game from the 90s I really want to play again.
    </p>
    <p>
        More coming on this soon, including status tracking.
