title: Manager thoughts

As I've grown and developed as a manager, I've built various beliefs about what it means to be a great leader—and some anti-patterns to avoid. On this page and the linked documents, I'll collect these thoughts as I think of and worth through them. These documents are meant to be changed—they are not immutable—and they will grow as I do.

There's several reasons I've made this page. One is for me to force me to work through thoughts that exist in my head and solidify what I truly believe so that I can express this again to others in the future. Another reason is more hypothetical at the moment—this could be a great way to show others looking to hire me what I truly believe in. Lastly, these might be interesting documents to share with people I work with—a starting point for discussion with colleagues.
