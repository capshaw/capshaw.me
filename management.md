title: Thoughts on management
layout: post

I have been an engineering manager for almost five years now. During this time, I've built up beliefs about what it means to be a great leader. I've also developed thoughts on some anti-patterns to avoid at all costs. This part of my site collects these thoughts and beliefs.

# Opinions

- ðŸ“Œ [My management philosophy](/management/philosophy) â€” these are my core management tenets
- [Leaders should make their calendars public](/management/public-calendars) â€” transparency is key

# Documents

- [First 1x1 template](/management/first-1x1) â€” slightly outdated at this point and in need of a refresh
