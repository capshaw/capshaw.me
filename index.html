      Hello, I'm Andrew! I am an engineering manager in <span class="no-break">Austin, TX.</span> Feel free to <a href="/resume/AndrewCapshaw_resume.pdf">check out my resume</a> or <a href="/management/">read a bit about my thoughts on management</a>.

    <p>
      When not at work, I try to spend as much time outside as possible—running, gardening, or just relaxing in a nice park.

      I don't have much of a meaningful social media presence on the web, but you can catch me reading on <a href="https://goodreads.com/capshaw">goodreads</a>.
