      Hello, I'm Andrew! I am a software engineering manager in <span class="no-break">Austin, TX.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      When not at work, I try to spend as much time outside as possibleâ€”running, gardening, or just relaxing in a nice park.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't have much of a meaningful social media presence on the web, but you can also catch me reading on <a href="https://goodreads.com/capshaw">goodreads</a>.
