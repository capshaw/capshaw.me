Our dependence on automobiles causes us to waste long periods of time in traffic, which also brings the risk of a whole host of adverse health conditions. All those vehicles, the inefficient nature of suburban living, and the mass consumption of goods have significantly contributed to the greenhouse gas emissions that threaten the future of every being on the planet. And as we quickly cycled through low-quality goods, we also littered the lands and oceans with our trash. But it is not just the environment that has been affected.

In the coming chapters, I will make the case that we need a better transportation system and by extension better cities—but that Silicon Valley and its various global permutations will not deliver an equitable version of automobility simply by upgrading it with new technologies. Rather, improving our mobility systems requires going deeper to address the inherently political questions that the tech industry prefers to avoid about the way we build those systems in the first place. Technology alone cannot resolve the inequities of the existing transport system, especially when the visions in question are constrained by the elite perspectives of the people dreaming them up.

Zoning policies that were originally embraced because they were perceived to be good for business homogenized different areas of cities, regulated the built environment as a means of excluding undesirable people from certain neighborhoods, and were ultimately justified in the name of increasing property values. They had the effect of breaking the city up into distinct zones designed for specific uses, such as separating residential neighborhoods from where people worked and where they engaged in leisure activities. In pulling apart aspects of urban life that were once integrated, the city was sanitized. It became difficult to get anywhere without a car, and a side effect of that was the severing of social and community bonds that were much more common before the entrenchment of suburban living.

Gorz’s observation is connected to sociologist John Urry’s claim that the automobile was the “‘iron cage’ of modernity” in both a literal sense due to how it enclosed the driver, turning people into “anonymized flows of faceless ghostly machines,” but also because of how it constrained people “to live their lives in spatially stretched and time-compressed ways.”43 The truth was that, far from offering individual freedom, the automobile made drivers incredibly dependent on a whole host of commercial interests.

In these few sentences, Jobs linked the personal computer to the most important ideological aspect of the automobile: its association with individual freedom. The personal computer was being positioned as a device that “offers its power to the individual.” In the same way that the automobile could take the driver anywhere they wanted to go, the personal computer would put its “electronic intelligence” at the disposal of its individual owner to help them “deal with the complexities of modern society.” These new machines were “tools, not toys,” and would “do as much for the individual as the big computers did for the corporation in the 60s and 70s.”

Critical scholars Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron dubbed the ideology that grew out of this movement, especially as it found common cause with the neoliberal policies of the 1980s, the “Californian Ideology.” The way of thinking it embodied “simultaneously reflects the disciplines of market economics and the freedoms of hippie artisanship. This bizarre hybrid is only made possible through a nearly universal belief in technological determinism.”10 The counterculture’s aversion to politics was central to the Californian Ideology. Its adherents believed social change would happen by engaging in the market and trusting in the process of technological development to empower not only the individual, but also the wider world. The path to a better world was no longer in retreating from society or simply engaging with corporate America, but faith was also put in technology itself as the means to address social and economic challenges.

But, even more than that, the new narratives they embraced about the power of technology to promote economic growth and market-based innovation downplayed the role of government in enabling the development of most of the technologies that they profited from in the first place, and even how many of the businesses that now dominate the Valley received public support.

Echoing Hermosillo, Light explained that when virtual communities are under private ownership, “these agora function only in their commercial sense; the sense of the market space as site for civic life is subject to strict controls.”31 These early critical accounts of the nature of digital communities on a privatized network subject to commercial pressures were a warning of what was to come.

The degree of surveillance, enclosure, and commercialization on the internet was normalized over the course of several decades as narratives about the emancipatory potential of technology and the power of free markets were embraced by powerful interest groups that have no wish to see the status quo disrupted. Silicon Valley capitalists who have benefited from the commercialization of all this public research and the deregulation of the economy are able to influence the public—through tech publications and tech verticals at major media organizations—to think that the digital ecosystem we have today is the natural result of innovation and that technological progress can only take the form that serves their bottom line. Meanwhile, politicians from both major political parties in the United States developed financial ties to the tech industry and fear negative economic impacts from disrupting its monopolies. But this narrow perspective not only affects the way they see the future; it also risks extending these technologies more extensively into physical space as the new dominant industry seeks to reshape the physical environment to suit its interests.

The negative consequences generated by that transformation—whether it is the harmful influence on teenagers, broader political questions about the kind of information they choose to amplify, or any number of other concerns that people have—are not mistakes that have arisen in a benevolent campaign to connect the world, but the product of placing growth, profits, and power ahead of the common good.

In the same way that the fossil fuel infrastructure that spans the globe has been recognized as a threat to the climate and to human life itself, especially the people who live near the sites where it is extracted and refined, the mining industry has begun a significant expansion to support the mass production of electric vehicles, and it too will create mass suffering and environmental damage unless we address the role of passenger vehicles in our transportation system and prioritize mobility that is more efficient, both in its resource use and in the way it operates.

Instead of trying to have personal electric vehicles match the scale of personal gas or diesel vehicles, the emphasis should instead be on getting people to shift from driving to taking transit and cycling, while building more walkable communities where necessities are closer to home. For example, electric buses and bikes use far fewer minerals per person than personal vehicles, and the size of batteries in buses can be further reduced if there are overhead wires from which they can charge en route, instead of just while parked at the depot.

The assumption of many autonomous vehicle boosters is that they will reduce the number of necessary parking spaces, which will free up space for development, increase urban density, and reduce suburban sprawl—but that is not guaranteed. Depending on how autonomous vehicles are priced, they could incentivize longer commutes, especially if riders see them as more comfortable because they will not have to drive, allowing them to use their phones, watch videos, sleep, or do any number of other things. For a company like Google, whose primary source of revenue is advertising, having a large captive audience to which it can serve ads throughout their journeys could be an attractive expansion of that segment of its business.

Further, placing so much of the transportation system under the control of algorithmic planners creates risks similar to those that exist in shipping networks: not only can everything be tracked, but they are also vulnerable to cyberattack and other means of failure. The argument for autonomous vehicles suggests that the only way to rectify the serious problems that exist in transportation systems is to heavily digitize their operation and ensure every aspect is constantly tracked and managed—yet that does not guarantee that any of the problems we are grappling with will be effectively addressed. Over many decades, racist and discriminatory policies have shaped cities and their social fabrics, and automated driving systems could simply entrench those patterns.

technologies developed within the context of a transportation system designed to serve automobiles before pedestrians will replicate the problems with those systems; they will not solve them. Anyone hoping to fix the problems with the existing transportation system and the broader urban landscape that has evolved out of it must dig deeper into the roots of those problems instead of mistakenly believing that adding new technological solutions will address them.

As more space was made for cars on existing streets, new roads built for them, and eventually freeway systems that cemented their supremacy, each of those actions was not just responding to demand but inducing greater demand for automobiles and places to drive them. As traffic got worse, those demands increased, and the additional roads built as a result only served to make the problem worse again: not only were people incentivized to drive more, but communities were constructed with the assumption that everyone would drive, thereby closing off access to alternatives.

After reviewing how the system developed, it is impossible to conclude anything other than its plan was never to solve congestion for everyone, but for one person in particular: Elon Musk. The Boring Company was yet another case of elite projection, where Musk framed a tunnel that would be personally convenient as something that could work for everyone. In fact, the first tunnel that Musk proposed was supposed to run along Interstate 405—the same one that Los Angeles had widened to try to reduce traffic congestion—from an area near Musk’s then-residence in Bel Air to SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne where he usually worked. It was a tunnel to allow him to evade traffic on his daily commute that he built a larger vision around—one that allowed him to sell it not just to the public and the media, but to the lawmakers whose approvals he would need to make it a reality.

In 1973, as André Gorz wrote about the automobile as a luxury object, he also observed that it “has made the big city uninhabitable.” It has made it stinking, noisy, suffocating, dusty, so congested that nobody wants to go out in the evening anymore. Thus, since cars have killed the city, we need faster cars to escape on superhighways to suburbs that are even farther away. What an impeccable circular argument: give us more cars so that we can escape the destruction caused by cars.

As one former employee told Gordon, not having to lock the bikes and scooters at the end of the ride “turns the vehicles into trash and blocks the sidewalk, which is both bad for business and bad for cities.”

Too often, governments stand back and allow the tech industry to roll out whatever ideas its executives and engineers can dream up. There is an assumption that whatever tech companies want is inevitable—it is the future—and that neither governments, traditional companies, nor even the public should stand in their way. But after more than a decade of their push into urban space, we need to reset our assumptions. Their ideas of the future are not the only path forward, and they often benefit people like themselves at the expense of low-income and marginalized residents. That is not the way to create more equitable communities; instead it allows the tech sector to shape our existence to serve their narrow interests.

The technologies unleashed by Silicon Valley are not neutral. They contain within them the worldviews of the people who develop them; and when they go unquestioned, we allow those very people to make important decisions about how and for whom our society should operate without any democratic deliberation. When we assume that technology can only develop in one way, we accept the power of the people who control that process, but there is no guarantee that their ideal world is one that truly works for everyone.

When we assume that technology can only develop in one way, we accept the power of the people who control that process, but there is no guarantee that their ideal world is one that truly works for everyone. They champion ideas that would ensure that automobiles continue to dominate our transportation system, that active mobility becomes a rentier service as its adoption grows, and that sidewalks are converted into a space for robots instead of people. Such a future would be hostile to the goal of more egalitarian cities and would make us more dependent on commercial interests rather than trying to free us from their control. The futures suggested by the technologies profiled so far are not the kind of world we should be striving toward.

In the pages that follow, I will outline three future scenarios that are far more realistic and illustrate the world that is being created: first, it is even more segregated based on income; second, it is even more hostile to pedestrians; and third, it wants to use unaccountable technological systems to control even more aspects of our lives.

In the same way that the urban landscape was sanitized to make way for the automobile, a similar process will be necessary to make way for the frictionless world of technologically mediated consumption that tech companies desire to usher in. There are benefits to some forms of on-demand services and ecommerce, but the way they are designed and implemented under capitalism does not enrich communities, nor make them more equitable. Rather, they take away the human elements that are perceived as friction and hollow out our social existence.

In 2015, journalist Lauren Smiley described the growing on-demand, app-based economy as the shut-in economy, where “you’re either pampered, isolated royalty—or you’re a 21st century servant.”10 Smiley observed that San Francisco was increasingly divided into two groups. On one side were the tech workers and a broader group of “knowledge” workers who earned high salaries, worked long hours, and used the gig apps to get everything from food delivery and laundry services to house cleaning, dog walking, and childcare. On the other was the contract labor force that delivered those services with few protections, no benefits, and precariously low pay. But the apps allowed the served to ignore the conditions of their app-based servants. They could even avoid seeing them altogether.

There is a direct transfer of power from residents to the tech companies in the app-based city, and as control over interactions and transactions shifts to vast technological systems, there is also a loss of accountability. In exchange for frictionlessness for people who have reaped the benefits of the modern economy, there are growing barriers for those who have not—barriers that can quickly appear where they did not previously exist, and which cannot easily be resolved because they are controlled by algorithms instead of human beings.

If there was ever a time when companies paid heed to the well-being of communities, it is long past. Modern corporate culture is a parasitic force, and one that only gets worse as digital rentier services are rolled out in more aspects of our lives. Building better cities requires taking housing, transport, and other essential services out of the market altogether, and running them as public services with democratic accountability.

The shift to suburban living in the postwar period and the mass consumption that accompanied it also contributed to the erosion of community spaces. As distances got longer and people were pushed to individually build private wealth, there was less incentive to maintain the public sphere. Wealthy and even middle-class residents had their own lawns, so they no longer went to public parks, and they got their own swimming pools to avoid community pools. They built in-home gyms to avoid public gyms, and even in-home cinema rooms are becoming a more popular alternative to visiting the movie theater.

Better futures are possible, but they will not be delivered through technological advancement alone. They require engaging with the problems of our time and recognizing that they do not exist simply because we do not have the requisite technology to solve them. Addressing the inequities and harms of our world does not require the invention of new technologies; it requires a new politics that recognizes economic growth and technological innovation do not guarantee social progress.

Ultimately, building better cities and improving people’s lives requires challenging the very structures of capitalism itself, structures that are designed to serve profit before people. We can build transportation systems that empower people, facilitate social connections, and reduce the environmental footprint of mobility. But that requires altering social and economic relations to ensure the planning of those systems is based in community needs, not delivering financial returns.
