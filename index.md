# Hello, you found me!

Hi, I'm Andrew. I am a software engineering manager and aspiring native gardener based out of Austin, TX. I use this site as a place to [journal](/journal/), [track my reading list](/reading/), and [track progress on my personal goals](/goals/). I also keep a loosely organized [wiki](/lists/).

If you're interested in learning a bit more about me as an engineer, you can find my [code](/code), [work philosophy](/work), and details about [hiring me](/hire) on this site as well.

If you want to get in touch, free to [email me](mailto:andrew.capshaw@gmail.com). You can also find me on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/axion-universe), [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/capshaw/), and [Github](https://github.com/capshaw).

Please feel free to [subscribe to my site's RSS feed](/feed.xml).
