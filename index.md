Hi there! I'm Andrew. I'm a software engineer and aspiring native gardener. This is my personal site where I collect a variety of miscellany.

Outside of this site, you won't really find me much on social media. You can join me on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/axion-universe) or the [Concept2 logbook](https://log.concept2.com/profile/2015678) if you'd like. Those are social media, right? ...right?

Want to get in touch? Feel free to email me using my first name at this domain.
