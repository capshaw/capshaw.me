Hi there! I'm Andrew. I'm a software engineer and aspiring native gardener.

This is my personal site where I collect [things I write](/journal), [photos I take](/photos), and [other miscellany](/experiments). 

Outside of this site, you won't really find me much on social media, though you can join me on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/axion-universe) or the [Concept2 logbook](https://log.concept2.com/profile/2015678) if you'd like. Those are social media, right? ...right?

Feel free to email me using my first name at this domain.
