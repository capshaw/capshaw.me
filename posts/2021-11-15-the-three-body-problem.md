Clunky, a missed opportunity.

The book had some neat ideas about first contact with aliens, but the execution was lacking. Characters were plot-driven and their motivations unconvincing. Various parts of the book read like a fan-fiction celebrating various parts of the science world (name dropping famous scientists, fundamentals of how computers work, components of physics)—but in ways that were distracting and took away from the plot of the novel.

I bought the entire trilogy on kindle—but I'm not sure I even care to read the rest.
