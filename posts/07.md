I'm currently rounding out the longest break I've taken since I started full-time work two-and-a-half years ago. It's been especially relaxing being able to not worry about a daily "grind". Having absolute freedom to choose my schedule and what I do with my time.

With complete freedom comes the risk that I'll go off and waste time sitting in front of a computer, doing nothing of meaning.

This is why I find it's really important for me to create a schedule or plan for what I want to do any given day. This allows me to prioritize things that are important to me and not waste time doing unimportant things.

But what's really important? What's meaningful? Do I need to be productive in my free time? I don't know the answers.
