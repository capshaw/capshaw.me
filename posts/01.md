Recently I caught the travel bug from various people in my life: friends, a girlfriend, acquaintances. So I've been traveling a lot.

On one of those trips, I realized that I was spending an inordinate amount of time thinking about captions for a photo I took. *What's the optimal caption to post with this photo on Instagram?*

I was horrified realizing what my brain was doing. I wanted to *win*. It's really an art deciding what to post. Deciding what not to post. And I wanted to optimize it. Shitty captions don't get likes. Shitty pictures don't get likes.

I've always had trouble with comparing myself against others. And likes are a direct way to measure one's competency at social media. A direct way to compare two people.

For better or worse, when there's a metric provided to people they want to optimize it. Gamified life. A socially engineered product. Social Media becomes a game we're playing with ourselves and with others.

And in doing so, it becomes incredibly easy to compare oneself against the aggregate sum of all of one's friends. The best athlete. The best scholar. The most suave. The best looking. In that game, we will always lose. We are one person, not five.
