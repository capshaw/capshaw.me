> If you act on the assumption that things can change, well, maybe they will. Okay, the only rational choice, given those alternatives, is to forget the pessimism.

Three stars for the Q&A format which was ultimately tedious; four or more stars for the ideas contained within.

Overall the word for this book is _breadth_. The four-hundred page book covers almost as many distinct topics as there are pages. As such, this book is a great introduction to many of these ideas and valuable as a thought-provoking starting place. 

The Q&A format gets tedious because of the repetitious structure and rapid change-of-pace in topics within the book. Ultimately, no matter how well edited the book is, the conversational nature leads to a scatter-brained result.

I ended up skimming much of the last 30% of the book due to the tedium. In fact, I suspect a strategy of seeking out small bits of content within—and pertaining to subjects one cares about—is a way to enjoy this book a bit more. I will consider revisiting it in this way over the years.
