<p>
    I take a lot of photos both at home and while traveling, but the photos at home are not nearly as interesting to look at. 
    
    Unless you like <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/capshaw/53050936918">birds</a>.
    
    This page contains links to some of the more interesting albums.
