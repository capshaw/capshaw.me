The below presentation is what started this section of my personal site. It's a presentation I created to demonstrate my core beliefs as a manager. It's honestly never been meant to be presented, but is rather intended as a supporting document to help me talk through my beliefs when entering a new relationship with a direct report or manager. It forces me to have talking points to help these colleagues understand what I believe in. At this point, it's fairly old and probably worth revisiting soon.

<a href="/manager-beliefs/AndrewCapshaw_beliefs.pdf">Here's a standalone link to the below embedded presentation</a> if that is more convenient. Understandably, the iframe isn't the most user-friendly. I intend to revisit this page's structure soon.
