I'm not a huge fan of the technical interview for software engineers. Below are misc. ideas I've had around this—most probably bad.

- Design your own process / Interview on your own battlefield (choose your interview, show certain set of requirements, points)
- Undo exercise. A regression has happened, here is the changeset, what is the fix?
- Correspondence interview (email/written communication)
- Tell people questions ahead of time 
- Writing as most important thing; documentation and persuasive writing interview
- Manager: What are your thoughts about consistency? At what level should things be standardized?
- 'Make it better'; quick hack --> next phase; like code review
