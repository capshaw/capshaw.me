Things I might wish to write a journal entry about.

- no/minimal JS and no tracking
- printing physical photos
- opinions.txt
  - prefer public channels
  - DMs bad
  - git documentation great
  - docs are dead end
  - writing as key remote skill
- How this website is set up / deploy script
- Daily routine
- Fighting organizational complexity with complexity
- Almost every recurring meeting becomes not worth the cost (Revitalize or delete)
- Meetings without an agenda ahead of time is rude to others time. Also not effective
- management via democracy
