This is a living brain-dump of things that have crossed my mind that could be interesting blog posts.

# Productivity
- Document: calendar as todo list
    - On using calendar for things to do (capture real time of doing things, protect)
- Doing repeatedly unwell vs doing with intentionality

# Software engineering
- Engineering as gardening
- Giving feedback as important work that is undervalued
- Reading and understanding as important work that is undervalued
- Confluence of top down single-threaded = mess (leaders only having to think in isolation)
- Ownership without coordination is bad = chaos
- Status meetings as non-productivity
- Incentives / disincentives for 'heroic' work
  - Promotions in a state of crisis
    - Look for actual solving of problem
    - Look out for laundering of responsibility
    - Look out for increasing organizational complexity being main output
    - Look out for incentives
- Org chart shapes and inconsistencies between functions (outcomes?)
- Second law of thermodynamics and organizations
- Remote work and floating islands (seating chart test)
- Inviting the right people to meetings = key; agenda = important
